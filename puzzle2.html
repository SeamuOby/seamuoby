    <h1>Puzzle 12: Grandma Got Run Over by a Blamedeer</h1>
    <p>
        It was a cold, snowy Christmas Eve when the incident occurred. Grandma was strolling home from the bakery, arms full of freshly baked pies, when suddenly a flash of red and a clatter of hooves sent her pies flying. She tumbled into a snowdrift as the culprit darted off into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other reindeer, along with a suspiciously festive Steve Aoki, gathered to plead their innocence. Grandma discovered two clues at the scene: a tuft of red fur snagged on her scarf and the unmistakable remnants of frosting and sprinkles near the impact zone. The suspects all seemed eager to explain themselvesâ€”except for Vixen, whose behavior wasâ€¦ concerning.
    </p>
    
    <div class="suspect">
        <strong>Dasher:</strong>
        <p>
            â€˜It wasnâ€™t me!â€™ Dasher protested. â€˜Chris and I were watching a Jurassic World marathon in the North Pole Cinema. And I definitely wasnâ€™t anywhere near Grandmaâ€”ask Chris!â€™ he added, a little too defensively.
        </p>

    <div class="suspect">
        <strong>Dancer:</strong>
        <p>
            Dancer adjusted a pair of tiny sequined boots and pirouetted dramatically. â€˜Hold me closer,â€™ he murmured, looking wistfully at the falling snow. â€˜Iâ€™ve been dancing under the headlights for hours, lost in Eltonâ€™s melodies. My hooves didnâ€™t even touch the ground tonight.â€™
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="suspect">
        <strong>Prancer:</strong>
        <p>
            Prancer proudly held up a parade schedule. â€˜I was marching through the Christmas parade with the entire village watching. My hooves were practically glittering, and I was in formation the whole time.â€™ He smirked smugly.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="suspect">
        <strong>Vixen:</strong>
        <p>
            Vixen stood quietly to the side, adjusting the latch on her suitcase, which bore a sticker reading "Property of the Strategic North Pole Defense Initiative." â€˜Iâ€™m not saying what I was doing,â€™ she said cryptically, as the faint hum of a Geiger counter began to echo softly. â€˜But trust me, it wasâ€¦ important. And no, I definitely didnâ€™t need to run. My work has global implications.â€™ She paused to polish the keypad on her suitcase, which flashed a tiny countdown timer for reasons she refused to explain.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="suspect">
        <strong>Rudolph:</strong>
        <p>
            Rudolph huffed indignantly. â€˜If my nose had been anywhere near Grandma, she wouldâ€™ve seen me coming a mile away. I was guiding Santaâ€™s sleigh on the other side of town.â€™ His glowing nose flickered angrily.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="suspect">
        <strong>Steve Aoki:</strong>
        <p>
            Steve grinned and spun a glowing peppermint turntable. â€˜Look, I was just commuting to the Christmas rave in the next town over. Sure, I cut through the village, but I was focused on my beats! And maybe I dropped a little cake on the way, but who hasnâ€™t?â€™ He laughed nervously, brushing icing off his jacket.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        As Grandma mulled over the clues, she considered the frosting and sprinkles, the erratic hoofprints, and the red fur snagged on her scarf. Vixen seemed far too preoccupied with a literal nuclear device to have been involved in a minor collision, but what about Steve?
